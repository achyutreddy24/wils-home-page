# Wil's Home Page
This is a firefox plugin that replaces the default new tab page with a replica of opera's speed dial home page. It is designed to seemlessly integrate with your current firefox bookmarks.

## Rational
The main reason I made this was for my own convenience. Having an accessable easy, graphical way to both access and edit bookmarks is a feature that pretty much every browser besides opera and vivaldi (a reimagining of the old opera browser) are missing. I could not find an even halfway decent free speed dial plugin on the Firefox plugin store and figured if I wanted somthing done right I should just do it myself.
