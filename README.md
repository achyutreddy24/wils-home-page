# Wil's Home Page
This is a firefox plugin that replaces the default new tab page with a replica of opera's speed dial home page. It is designed to seemlessly integrate with your current firefox bookmarks. The only external library used was the Mithril javascript library (essentially a super lightweight react-like library). I chose it because it was very easy to learn and the entire library can be put in a single javascript file which makes packaging the plugin easy.

## Rational
The main reason I made this was for my own convenience. Having an accessable easy, graphical way to both access and edit bookmarks is a feature that pretty much every browser besides opera and vivaldi (a reimagining of the old opera browser) are missing. I could not find an even halfway decent free speed dial plugin on the Firefox plugin store (none of them fully integrate with your current firefox bookmarks and most of them look ugly). I figured if wanted somthing done right I should just do it myself.

## Planned Features
Striked through features are done and working
* ~~navigatable grid display of bookmark and folder tiles~~
* settings page (set background image and root folder for speed dial display)
* good looking and customizable images for boomark tiles
* graphical editing and reordering of bookmark
* new bookmark / new folder buttons
